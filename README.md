# Creepinson's Setup

## Vim

I am using some code from Ben Awad's [vscode setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnupOrSEikQ). 
S[ee my vimrc for more information](dotfiles/.vimrc).

## Shell

I am using the zsh shell along with [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/).

## OS

I am running Manjaro KDE, alongside Windows 10 Pro... and if you are wondering, no, I did not pay $200 for a windows license key! Instead, I bought one from [g2deal](https://g2deal.com) for $14 and it works fine.
